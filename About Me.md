- 👋 Hi, I’m @Keklad
- 👀 I’m an Audio Designer/Engineer. I have worked on the audio for about 11 small games so far.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to create spatial audio for VR and other immersive game formats. I am also learning how to use Audio Middlewares Wwise and FMOD.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on larger scale projects. Hit me up if your game needs music/sound.
